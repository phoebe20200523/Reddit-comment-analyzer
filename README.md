# Reddit-comment-analyzer
Apache spark application for analytics of Reddit comments
  Built a microservice architecture to analyze over 18 million real-world comments on Reddit.
  Adopted Apache Spark as the message broker in the data processing pipeline to decouple the comment ingestion and word extraction based on named entity recognition and conducted analysis on the local machine.
  Deployed the Spark application to AWS S3 and EMR cluster for faster analysis (50% less time consumed)
